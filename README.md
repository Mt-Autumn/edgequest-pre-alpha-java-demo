# Edgequest pre-alpha Java Demo
Edgequest is a rouge inspired, top down game. The game takes place in a infinite sandbox that contains an above ground and multiple levels of underground dungeons. This demo has been written in Java to help illustrate the above ground mechanics of the game. Due to its pre-alpha state, many features have yet to be added and optimizations still need to be made.

##Future Plans
Future plans for edgequest include adding sub-biome level block generation, AI, foliage, animals, and online multiplayer as well as a chat, item inventory, crafting, food, stamina, weapons, and more. Keep an eye out on this repository for future releases.
